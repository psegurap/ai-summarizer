Administration officials have lined up to defend White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, including leaders she insulted over the course of 11 on-the-record interviews with a writer for the magazine Vanity Fair.

Wiles and her allies said the two resulting articles, published Tuesday, took her out of context and cast the team in a negative light. Joining an outpouring of supportive statements from Cabinet secretaries and White House staffers, President Donald Trump praised Wiles and attacked Vanity Fair.

“I didn’t read it, but I don’t read Vanity Fair — but she’s done a fantastic job,” Trump told the New York Post on Tuesday. “I think from what I hear, the facts were wrong, and it was a very misguided interviewer, purposely misguided.”

Tuesday’s articles caught Wiles and her staff by surprise. Two people close to Wiles, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly, said she thought her conversations with the writer, Chris Whipple, were for a book, and she didn’t expect him to quote her so extensively. Other White House staff members were not aware of Wiles’s interviews with Whipple, according to the people close to Wiles and the Vanity Fair article.

The Vanity Fair article said the conversations with Wiles were on the record.

Wiles and other top advisers, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, participated in a photo shoot and interviews for the story. The people close to Wiles said staff expected the photos to be taken by Annie Leibovitz, the famed photographer who has previously documented politicians for Vanity Fair, and they did not expect long articles to accompany the pictures.

Photographer Christopher Anderson shot the images published in the articles. Vanity Fair editor Mark Guiducci also attended the nine-hour visit to the White House.

“We should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets,” Vance, whom Wiles was quoted as calling a “conspiracy theorist,” said Tuesday at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. “Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true.”

The chief of staff said in a social media post that the articles “disregarded” what she called “significant context.”

“The article published early this morning is a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history,” Wiles wrote.

Wiles also received support Tuesday from Donald Trump Jr. and almost every Cabinet member — including Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Wiles said “whiffed” the release of the Epstein files, and budget director Russell Vought, whom she called a “right-wing absolute zealot.”

“Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.”

Trump has previously begrudged advisers whom he viewed as claiming too much credit or attention. In his first term, he fired chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon after he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Last year, Trump was irritated with advisers, including Wiles, who cooperated with an extensive article in the Atlantic during the campaign.

Wiles said she spoke with Trump about the article Tuesday morning and he wasn’t mad, since he relates to feeling misrepresented in the media, according to one of the people close to her.

Trump has expressed appreciation for Wiles’s tendency to keep a low profile, such as when she declined to take a bow at his election night party, nicknaming her on the spot “the ice maiden.” But he’s also complained when advisers aren’t defending him on TV. This month, Wiles gave a rare interview on the right-wing program “The Mom View,” in which she said Trump would actively campaign for Republicans in the 2026 midterms.

“Susie is someone who has stood with the president through weaponized indictments, coordinated law fare and assassination attempts,” said Danielle Alvarez, who worked with Wiles on the 2024 Trump campaign. “The fake news is going to do what the fake news is going to do. The president’s team is focused on delivering his America First agenda.”
